1853,1853-in-the-realms-of-the-unreal,https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1853-in-the-realms-of-the-unreal,"This is a 2004 documentary film by Jessica Yu introducing the life and work of Henry Darger. A major figure of ""outsider art"", Darger's work was only discovered after his death when his landlords found thousands of pages of text and paintings in his room. Through his long life, he was known to his few friends and associates only as a janitor in a local hospital. Secretly, he wrote a massive manuscript chronicling the rebellion of girl slaves in a fantasy world, painted with watercolors of the heroines and battles."
11804,11804-white-noise,https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/11804-white-noise,"White Noise fizzles out its noisy static by just being plain boring. Watching Keaton as he unconvincingly stares at televised white noise for an hour and a half, which is essentially nothing, perfectly surmises the experience of Sax' supposedly supernatural horror. However, the biggest crime that the studio committed was releasing the feature on the first weekend of the year. Now, it's common knowledge that the initial start to the cinematic year typically begins with a disposable horror. Well, White Noise is to blame. Signalling untapped box office potential, despite the overt opinions of crit...read the rest."
33766,33766-smooth-talk,https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/33766-smooth-talk,"Based on a short story by Joyce Carol Oates called ""Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?"", ""Smooth Talk"" stars Laura Dern as a bored and restless adolescent who thinks she's more in control of her sexual allure, and more capable of handling the attention she receives for it, than she is. In a deeply unsettling and slightly surreal scene, a hunky stranger (Treat Williams) comes calling for her, and she realizes that she's not as mature as she thinks. The film captures the same other-worldly quality of the short story (the scene with Treat Williams plays out almost like a feverish dream), wh...read the rest."

Paul (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is 21 and has just finished his national service.

Honestly I really hope one day we get a documentary and even some footage of the various cuts and actors who were removed.

Some element of comedy, very black humour, remains but overall the film is a family tragedy."

1817,1817-phone-booth,https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1817-phone-booth,"Phone Booth dials up its millennial tension through suspenseful confined calls. Joel Schumacher is a rather inconsistent director. Unusual, yet capricious. From ‘The Lost Boys’ to ‘Batman & Robin’, his career has been considerably scattershot in terms of quality. Phone Booth, whilst quintessentially being a product of its time, happens to be his most simplistic. An arrogant publicist is held hostage in a phone booth by a mysterious sniper who offers him an ultimatum."

It maybe leans too heavily on a nostalgia that I simply don't have, but personally I found this to be one of Zombie's weaker entries. Great song! But I don't totally love the movie. I like it. I wish that some of the parts I found more interesting, like Doctor Satan, got a bit more play, and both the acting and video quality often leave something to be desired, but still, I like it."

It is not a great film, but has just about enough romance and daftness to work.

Sure, there’s plenty of action and cool stunts but I do not feel they follow the spirit of the TV-show. In the TV-show they got their mission and then they completed it, tricking the bad guys, with the full backing of the IMF team. No political bullshit, betrayal of the team and such like nonsense."
402900,402900-oceans-8,https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/402900-oceans-8,"Ocean's Eight has been my comfort movie for the longest time. I adore the strength of the cast, and the dynamics they possess as a whole, not to mention the brilliant cinematography. The humour and the relationships of the characters brings a sense of lightheartedness to the movie, which I personally adore. Overall, it's a very underappreciated movie in terms of the writing, casting and cinematography, as well as the costume and makeup departments."

420634,420634-terrifier,https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/420634-terrifier,Terrifier is a gory movie with a sadistic killer clown that revels in mutilating his victims in creative ways and willing to use any kind of improvised weapon as well as one not often seen in slasher movies. The movie makes effective use of practical effects and the gory murders are graphic enough to make you know this movie means business. David Howard Thornton stars as Art the Clown and his portrayal is devilishly effective as a villain who is mute and must use facial gestures to express himself in his ghoulish clown makeup. The story is the usual cat and mouse variety but this film is more a...read the rest.

You don’t need to know much about Korean politics to enjoy ‘The Spy Gone North’; you only need an appreciation for political intrigue and tension-inducing filmmaking in general.

Neither principal performance is particularly engaging; and Jack Lowden and Joe Alwyn are frankly hopeless as the sexually ambiguous ""Darnley"" and ""Leicester"" respectively.

A salacious tell-all about the hidden sex lives of postwar movie stars; a peek at the underbelly of the repressive moral dictates of the studio system; a breezy biography of a self-described Hollywood prostitute and procurer; and a psychosexual study of a possibly damaged victim of extreme childhood abuse."

Romantic comedies. The amalgamation of two genres that exercise the very worst tendencies of Hollywood’s mechanical repetitions. Modern romcoms follow the same formulaic narrative structure and embed the same interpretive clichés. Y’know what I’m talking about.

However, the script is sadly so entry-level that it struggles to challenge audiences in the face of its desire to have universal appeal and accessibility. It’s still worth seeing, but only for the work of the cast and to inspire discourse on the topics the film touches on – no doubt deeper than the film itself.

Jack Black and Cate Blanchett are great together in this film. The film felt like a 80s kids horror film. I would love to see more films with these characters. There are a few poop jokes which were the worst part of the film (but these jokes seem to be expected in modern kids films). I feel like this film would have cult film status in a few years.

Don't get me wrong, Rami Malek deserves props for the role, that much is true (less perhaps than he's been getting, but still, props). But beyond that,Bohemian Rhapsodyis bland, choppy, arguably even offensive.

The movie satirizes the cultural clashes all around us and focuses on the particularly strange cult of personality that infuses big motion picture Hollywood.
This is a feel-good date movie that teaches you that following your dreams doesn't get you where you think you're going but they get you where you need to be."

Its pacing isn’t perfect and the result is a story that lags at times, but this film bravely tells a story rarely seen on screen, let alone from within the LGBT community. And fear not - despite its heavy subject, it finishes with a happy ending that’s both fitting and still grounded in reality. ‘Papi Chulo’ is an important start to a discussion that requires a much larger conversation.

For me, it was like hearing myself for the  past 40 years.

We see various multicultural productions of the Jewish-based show from Tokyo to African American high schools; the story of Tevye and his five daughters speaks to so many different races and gender, and ‘Fiddler’ has something for everyone to connect to. There is something truly transcendent about musicals - they have the ability more so than any other medium to touch and connect with so many, and ‘Fiddler on the Roof’ is a prime example of that power.

John Woo is not the right person to make a Mission Impossible movie."

10481,10481-102-dalmatians,https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/10481-102-dalmatians,"I remember loving this film as a kid. Rewatching the film as an adult, the film does not hold up. I really remember the third act of the film before rewatching the film and it is going to be the only thing I will remember about the film. There are two fun scenes in my opinion: the ending and Cruella De Vil transformation back into her evil self. Glenn close is the only great thing from the film. This is not one you need to seek out if you have not seen it."

It explores the themes of loss, grief, and growing up in a captivating way that resonates with anyone who has faced challenges in life. It balances the drama with moments of humor, especially in the interactions between the young boy and his father, who have a realistic and touching bond. The ending was satisfying and emotional. The movie also excels in its visual aspects, with stunning cinematography, art direction, and setting that create a vivid atmosphere of the Sicilian culture and lifestyle of the time period in which the movie is set.

2669,2669-the-bounty,https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/2669-the-bounty,"When you already have a definitive version of a story on film (1935) it's always tough to remake it successfully. To be fair to Roger Donaldson, he has managed to come pretty close - and do far better than the 1962 iteration - with this well cast telling of a story of mutiny and brutality. It's told by way of a retrospective as Lord Hood (Lord Olivier) conducts an investigation into what happened aboard the ill-fated ship. Anthony Hopkins is the disciplinarian Lt. Bligh in charge of the glorified freighter ""HMS Bounty"" which is charged with heading to Tahiti to secure breadfruit trees that can...read the rest."

""Bond"" is assigned to aid would-be defector ""Gen. Koskov"" (Jeroen Krabbé) from Berlin, along the way encountering the lethal cellist ""Kara"" (Maryam d'Abo).
